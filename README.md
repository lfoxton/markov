# Markov Chain Demo

This is a little project to try out some tools i have been wanting to mess with.

Markov chains are simple state chain algorythms. A sequence of possible events 
in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the 
previous event.

Some of the tools showcased here.

* Springboot
* Gradle
* Bootstrap
* Thymeleaf
* Java 7

## To run it

* Install gradle
* Go to the root folder
* Run in developer mode > gradle bootRun
* Go to localhost:8080 in your browser
